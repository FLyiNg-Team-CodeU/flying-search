What are we going to build?
An improved, faster Wikipedia search engine that allows for more user interaction.

What is the mission of your product?
To be more user-friendly and allow users to retrieve results at faster speeds.

What aspect of the project are you most passionate about improving?
The command line front end that allows users to input information.

Which features are your top three most important features to accomplish this mission?
1) Front-end command line
2) Faster/more complex searches
3) Order in terms of popularity (number of views)







Of those three features, rank your first, second and third priority.
Can be determined with group


How are we going to build the product?

1. User-observed difference? How will the user notice a difference? Give a specific example of your new improvement working. For example: “When the user enters ‘apples’ the app, the user currently sees pages X,Y and Z from wikipedia. After completing this feature, the user will see pages A,B and C.” If it’s a performance enhancement, make sure to mention the metric you are interested in. For example: “Currently, the user has to wait 5 seconds for results from the search `apple`. After completing this feature, the results should take only 1 second to retrieve.”
We can put in code to display how long the search took. Then we can show that the results are showing up faster. The user should find the command line makes it easier to use. Being able to see the URLs and copying them into another tab will help them find more relevant articles outside of wikipedia.

2. Outline of Approach: For each of the three features, what is the high level of your approach to getting the user observable result?

Not sure.

3. Further Research: What don’t you know that you need to know to complete these features?

Whether the reference link format is the same for each article and if it can be pulled out.


4. How will you break down the work? Who will work on what? Can you divide each feature into smaller chunks? What are those chunks?

Can be decided with group.


5. What will the most challenging part be? What do you expect to be the hardest part, and how will you approach it?

Figuring out the front end portion of the code. We want to possibly implement a command line and display relevant links from the references, but aren’t entirely sure how to write it out.
